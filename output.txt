2. LITERATURE SURVEY 
2.1 Brief Review: Analysis of 350 KWP Solar Plant in MIT Chh. Sambhajinagar: 
The growing demand for sustainable energy solutions has led to the increased deployment of 
solar  power  systems. The  350  KWP  solar  plant  at  MIT  Chh. Sambhajinagar,  represents  a 
significant step toward sustainable energy solutions in the region. This facility not only aims 
to  reduce dependency on  traditional  fossil  fuels  but  also  serves  as  a  practical  model  for 
educational purposes. 
 
Solar energy is the energy we get from the sun. It is a clean, renewable source of power that 
can help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, which are harmful to the environment. Here’s a 
simple breakdown of how solar energy works and its main components: 
How Solar Energy Works: 
When  sunlight  hits  a  solar  panel,  it  is  converted  into  electricity.  This  process  involves  a 
technology called photovoltaic (PV) cells. Here’s how it works step by step: 
Sunlight Absorption: Solar panels are made up of many smaller units called solar cells. These 
cells are made of materials like silicon that can absorb sunlight. 
Electricity Generation: When the sunlight strikes the solar cells, it excites the electrons in the 
silicon, causing them to move. This movement creates an electric current. 
Inverter Role: The electric current produced by the solar cells is direct current (DC). However, 
most  homes  and  businesses  use  alternating  current (AC).  An  inverter  converts  the  DC  into 
AC, making it usable for everyday appliances. 
 
2.1.1 Types of Solar Panels: 
There are mainly three types of solar panels: 
Monocrystalline Panels: Made  from a single crystal structure, these panels are efficient and 
take up less space. They are usually more expensive. 
Polycrystalline Panels: Made from multiple crystal structures, these panels are less expensive 
but also slightly less efficient than monocrystalline panels. 

 
4 
 
Thin-Film Panels/Amorphous silicon panels: These are  lightweight and  flexible  but usually 
have  the  lowest  efficiency.  They  are  often  used  in  specific  applications  like  building-
integrated photovoltaics. 
Here  we  are  using Amorphous  silicon  (a-Si)  technology,  It is  a  type  of  thin-film  solar  cell 
technology  that  uses  non-crystalline  silicon  to  convert  sunlight  into  electricity.  Here’s  a 
detailed explanation of it. 
 
2.1.2 Structure of Amorphous silicon : 
Amorphous silicon is a form of silicon that lacks a long-range crystalline structure. In contrast 
to crystalline silicon, which has a well-defined lattice arrangement, a-Si has a random atomic 
arrangement. 
This allows for the production of thin  films of silicon, which can be deposited onto various 
substrates like glass, plastic, or metal. 
How Does It Work? 
Light Absorption: When sunlight hits the solar cell, it gets absorbed. The energy from the light 
excites electrons in the silicon, freeing them from their atoms. 
Electricity  Generation: As  these  free  electrons  move, they  create  an  electric  current,  which 
can be used to power homes and devices. 
The  manufacturing  process  typically  involves  chemical  vapor  deposition  (CVD),  where 
silicon  gas  is  deposited  onto  a  substrate  to  form  a  thin  film.  This  process  is  less  energy-
intensive compared to the production of crystalline silicon cells. 
Key Features: 
Thin and Flexible: a-Si solar cells are very thin, often just a few micrometers thick. This makes 
them lightweight and flexible, allowing them to be used in a variety of applications. 
Lower  Efficiency: They  usually  convert  less  sunlight  into  electricity  than  traditional 
crystalline silicon panels, typically around 6% to 10%. 
Good in Heat: a-Si panels work well in hot temperatures, maintaining their efficiency better 
than some other types of panels.

2.1.3 Advantages of Amorphous Silicon Technology: 
Cost-Effective: The production process for a-Si panels is less expensive due to lower material 
requirements and simpler manufacturing techniques. 
Versatility: A-Si panels can be applied to a variety of surfaces, including curved or flexible 
substrates,  which  opens  up  new  installation  possibilities  (e.g.,  on  vehicles  or  building-
integrated photovoltaics). 
Performance in Low Light: A-Si technology performs relatively well in low-light conditions 
and partial shading, making it suitable for areas with less consistent sunlight. 
Reduced  Material  Use: Because  they  require  much  less  silicon  than  crystalline  panels,  a-Si 
cells can be produced with less environmental impact. 
Better  Performance  at  High  Temperatures: A-Si  cells  can  maintain  higher  efficiency  levels 
under hot conditions, making them suitable for warmer climates. 
Amorphous  silicon  (a-Si)  technology  offers  a  unique  way  to  harness  solar  energy.  While  it 
has some drawbacks like lower efficiency, its cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and performance 
in various light conditions make it a valuable option for many uses in renewable energy. As 
technology advances, a-Si solar cells could play a bigger role in the future of solar energy.

2.2 Economic Viability of Amorphous Silicon (a-Si) Solar Technology: 
What is Economic Viability?  
Economic viability means how cost-effective a technology is, including how much money it 
can save, how quickly it pays for itself, and whether it’s a good long-term investment. 
Key Factors in Economic Viability for a-Si Solar Cells: 
Lower Initial Costs:  
Cheaper to Make:  Amorphous silicon panels cost less to produce than traditional solar panels 
because they use less silicon and are easier to make. 
Easy to Install : These panels are lightweight and flexible, which can lower installation costs 
since they can be placed on different surfaces without needing heavy equipment. 
Energy Savings : 
Lower  Electricity  Bills :  By  generating  their  own  electricity,  users  can  significantly  reduce 
their energy bills. This means more money stays in their pockets over time. 
Payback Period : The money spent on the panels  can often be recovered within a few  years 
through these savings, making a-Si solar systems financially attractive. 
Growing Demand : 
Interest in Renewable Energy : As more people and businesses want sustainable energy, the 
demand  for solar technology  is  increasing. This could  lead to more investment in a-Si solar 
systems. 
Stable Energy Costs :  
Avoiding  Price  Increases :  Solar  energy  provides  a  consistent  source of  electricity,  helping 
users  avoid  the  ups  and  downs  of  fossil  fuel  prices.  This  stability  makes  financial  planning 
easier 

 
7 
 
The  economic  viability  of  amorphous  silicon  solar  technology  is  promising.  Its  lower 
production costs, potential energy  savings, and government  incentives  make  it an attractive 
choice.  While  challenges  like  lower  efficiency  and  market  perception  exist,  the  growing 
interest in renewable energy and the long-term financial benefits mean a-Si solar systems are 
a good option for many people. As technology improves, these systems are likely to become 
even more financially appealing. 
The economic assessment shows that the solar installation has a favorable payback period due 
to  decreasing  solar  panel  costs  and  available  government  incentives.  Long-term  savings  on 
energy  bills  are  projected to  benefit  the  institute  significantly,  allowing  for  reinvestment  in 
educational initiatives.

Economic Analysis: 
Cost-Benefit  Analysis:  Calculate  the  total   investment  cost  (including   installation  and 
maintenance)  against the  savings  generated  from  reduced  electricity  bills  and  any  available 
incentives or rebates. 
Payback Period: Determine the payback period, which is the time it takes for the savings to 
equal the initial investment. This is calculated as: 
Payback Period=Annual Savings/Total Investment 
Environmental Impact Assessment: 
Carbon Offset : Estimate the reduction  in  carbon emissions achieved  by using  solar energy 
instead of fossil fuels. This can be done using standard conversion factors. 
Life  Cycle  Assessment (LCA): Evaluate  the  environmental  impact  of  the  solar  panels  and 
system components throughout their life cycle, from manufacturing to disposal. 
The  analysis  of  the  350  KWP  solar  plant  at  MIT, highlights  its  effectiveness  in  energy 
generation, economic benefits, and positive environmental impact. As a pioneering project in 
Sambhajinagar,  it  serves  as  a  model  for  future  solar  initiatives,  promoting  both  educational 
and sustainability goals in the region.

2.3 Inverter and Its Role: 
What is an Inverter? 
An inverter is a crucial component in a solar power system. Its primary role is to convert the 
direct  current  (DC)  electricity  generated  by  solar  panels  into  alternating  current  (AC) 
electricity, which is used to power homes, businesses, and connect to the grid. 
 Role of the Inverter in the Solar Plant 
In the 350 KWP solar plant at MIT Chha, the inverter performs several essential functions: 
DC  to  AC  Conversion: Solar  panels  generate  electricity  in  the  form  of  DC.  The  inverter  
transforms this into AC electricity, which is suitable for everyday use and can be fed into the 
electrical grid. 
Maximizing  Energy  Production : The  inverter  optimizes  the  power  output  from  the  solar 
panels. It uses Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technology to ensure that the system 
operates at its most efficient point, adapting to changes in sunlight and temperature. 
Monitoring   Performance : The   inverter   includes   monitoring   features   that   track   the 
performance  of  the  solar  system.  This  allows  operators  to  see  how  much  energy  is  being 
produced, identify any issues, and maintain the system effectively. 
Grid  Connection : The  inverter  enables  the  solar  plant  to  connect  to  the  electrical  grid.  It 
ensures that the electricity  fed  into the grid  meets regulatory  standards and  is synchronized 
with grid voltage and frequency. 
Safety Features : Inverters, including the Fronius model, come equipped with safety features 
that  protect  both  the  solar  system  and  the  electrical  grid.  This  includes  anti-islanding 
protection, which prevents the inverter from feeding power back into the grid during a power 
outage. 
 
 

 
10 
 
In the 350 KWP solar plant at MIT , the inverter plays a vital role in converting DC electricity 
from the  solar panels  into AC electricity  for use and grid  connection. Its advanced features 
enhance energy production,  monitor performance, and ensure safety,  making  it an  essential 
component of the solar power system. By optimizing the output and providing valuable data, 
the inverter contributes significantly to the plant’s overall efficiency  and  effectiveness  in 
harnessing solar energy.

We have collected the past three months elecrticity bill of our institute to analyze units demand 
monthly as well as solar plant of MIT (350 KWP). 
 From first graph we have shown the analysis between units consumed montly and total bill 
amount the data obatined is of July , August and September. This graph held the overall data 
of Electricity Board (MSEB) and MIT’s Solar Power Plant of past three months as mentioned 
in graph. Here, in this chart we get data only about the units consumed from the Electricity 
generation board and billing amount.  
Here, 
 In the July month Units consumed are :- 67,678 KWH and Billing amount is 12,62,620/- For 
August month Units consumed are :- 81,175 KWH and Billing amount is 14,64,150/-  and for 
September month Units consumed are :- 80,156 KWH and Billing amount is 15,31,940/-  
The  Second  graph illustrate  details  about Overall  data  of  MIT’s Solar  Plant  Energy 
Generation. It gives  information about Units Generated and Cost Saved   through this solar 
plant   
In  the  July  month  Units  Generated  are  :- 20,219  KWH  and Cost  Saved is  3,03,285 /- For 
August  month  Units generated are  :- 23,493 KWH  and Cost  Saved is 3,52,395 /-  and  for 
September month Units generated are :- 25,184 KWH and Cost Saved is 3,77,760/-  
Now, taking a dig about institutes solar energy generation and consumption. The institute has 
installed the grid  for its own, it is connected to different buildings  in  its own the grid starts 
from  taking  supply  from  Electricity  boards  (feeder) now  the  supply  is  given  to  Institutes 
Transformer  of  11kv/415v it  covers  all  the buildings present in the  institute has  sanctioned 
load of 1430 KV . So to satisfy this load demand institude has decided to install its own solar 
energy erection of 350 KWP.The institute has its total demand of 1430 KW. So the solar plant 
can satisfy approximately about 25% of institutes total load demand.

5. FUTURE SCOPE 
Future Opportunities of Solar Plant Expansion at the Institute: 
Expanding  the  institute’s  solar  plant  from  350  kW  to 650  kW  opens  up  many  exciting 
possibilities  for  the  future.  This  larger  solar  setup  will  help  the institute  save  more  money, 
produce  cleaner  energy,  and  even  provide  learning  opportunities.  Here  are  some  key  areas 
where this solar expansion can benefit the institute and community in simple terms: 
1. More Energy Independence: With a bigger solar plant, the institute can produce more of its 
own electricity rather than relying heavily on outside sources. This helps avoid high electricity 
bills and makes the institute less dependent on external power, especially during times of high 
electricity demand or power cuts. 
2.  Bigger  Savings  on  Electricity  Costs:  By  generating  more  solar  power  on  campus,  the 
institute can reduce the amount it spends on electricity  bills. This  means that money  can be 
saved and used for other important things, like improving facilities or supporting students and 
research. 
3. Positive Impact on the Environment: Using more solar power instead of traditional energy 
sources cuts down on carbon emissions, which are harmful to the environment. By expanding 
the solar plant, the institute contributes to cleaner air and helps fight climate change. This step 
aligns with global goals for a greener and more sustainable future. 
4. Learning and Research Opportunities for Students: A larger solar plant on campus becomes 
a great tool for learning. Students in fields like engineering, environmental science, and energy 
studies can observe and study how the solar plant works in real-time. They can  learn about 
solar technology, monitor the plant’s energy production, and explore ways to make solar 
power even more efficient.

5. Room for New Technologies: As the institute expands its solar capacity, it can also consider 
adding  advanced  technologies,  like  energy  storage  systems  (batteries  that  store  extra  solar 
energy) and smart software that tracks energy production and usage. These tools can make the 
solar plant work even better, allowing the institute to store solar energy for cloudy days and 
nighttime, making the system more reliable. 
6. Engaging the Community: A larger solar plant is not only beneficial to the institute but can 
also inspire the community. By hosting events, tours, or educational workshops, the institute 
can show others the benefits of solar energy. This can encourage more people to consider solar 
power for their own homes or businesses, helping the wider community embrace renewable 
energy. 
In simple terms, the solar expansion will bring long-term benefits by saving money, protecting 
the  environment,  and  enriching  educational  experiences.  This  future-focused  approach  will 
strengthen the institute’s role as a leader in sustainability and show that switching to cleaner, 
renewable energy is both practical and rewarding.

CONCLUSION 
 MIT solar plant survey is a detailed study that helps us understand how solar energy benefits 
the  institute.  Through  this  survey,  we’re  learning  about  the  advantages  of  solar  energy, 
especially in terms of saving money by reducing electricity costs. 
In  this  survey,  we've  collected  important  data  on  the  solar  plant’s  components,  like  the 
inverters, solar panels, and other materials used in the project. This includes information on 
the  exact  number  of  inverters  and  solar  panels  needed  to  run  a  350  kW  solar  plant  at  the 
institute. With this data, we get a clear picture of how much energy the solar plant can produce 
and  the setup required  for it to  work efficiently.Additionally, we’re gaining  insights  into 
people’s general opinions and attitudes toward the solar plant. This helps us understand how 
well the project is supported and the level of interest in renewable energy. 
In the end, this survey provides us with useful knowledge about how solar energy benefits the 
institute,  both  financially  and  environmentally.  It  also  gives  us  a  solid  foundation  to 
successfully analyze and possibly improve the solar plant, making sure it operates at its best.
